This plugin will add Foundation 5 styles into TinyMCE in WordPress.

== Description ==

This plugin will add Foundation 5 styles into TinyMCE in WordPress.

Shortcodes are often hard for regular users as well advanced users to remember, especially if they haven’t used them in a while.

If a plugin is deactivated that makes use of a shortcode or a new theme is activated that doesn’t contain a shortcode then you will end up with shortcodes being output on the front-end of the website, e.g. [columns]. Instead with this plugin you'll just have a html element with a class that doesn’t have any styles so the browser will render it normally.

This plugin doesn't include the Zurb Foundation CSS/JavaScript files. This is meant to be used with a theme built with Zurb Foundation 5.


== Installation ==

Upload `foundation5-styles.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
